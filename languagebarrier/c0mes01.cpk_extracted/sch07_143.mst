0:My shoulder was shaken softly.\p;
100:It was extremely gentle, and after just one shake, it stopped.\p;
200:〔Kozue?〕“...”\p;
300:It felt like... someone was peering at my face.\p;
400:My consciousness was slowly returning to me.\p;
500:As it did, the pain in my body returned along with it.\p;
600:The smell in my nose... It was a smell so strong it made me want to vomit.\n;The smell of blood.\p;
700:〔Takumi〕“Nn...”\p;
800:I felt a tingling around my upper lip.\n;The taste of iron spread through my mouth.\p;
900:Slowly, I opened my eyes.\p;
1000:I was in the same back alley as before.\p;
1100:I was lying face-down on the asphalt, and right in front of me was a small, reddish-brown puddle of liquid, likely seeping out from one of the dumpsters.\p;
1200:Grimacing at the smell invading my nostrils, I sat up.\p;
1300:My whole body ached.\p;
1400:My face in particular hurt like hell. It was hot and tingly, like someone had taken a lighter and gasoline to it.\p;
1500:〔Girl〕“...”\p;
1600:Right beside me, a girl I recognized was kneeling down and looking at me. She looked like she was about to cry.\p;
1700:It was... the transfer student. The girl who'd transferred into my class.\p;
1800:Umm... what was her name again...? O-Ohara? Oshihara?\p;
1900:“Why was the transfer student here?” I wondered.\p;
2000:〔Transfer Student〕“...”\p;
2100:And then, the transfer student held out something to me.\p;
2200:It was my wallet.\n;Why did she have it...?\p;
2300:My head still foggy, I looked around.\p;
2400:〔Takumi〕“Eek...”\p;
2500:The three DQNs that had attacked me earlier were now lying in a pool of blood.\p;
2600:Wh-Wh-What the hell?\n;It was like they'd all been one-shot by some OP mob.\n;The faces of all three were barely still intact.\p;
2700:W-Were they dead?\n;None of them moved a single muscle.\p;
2800:No... Was this the 7th New Gen case...?!\p;
2900:Who the hell would do something like this...?\p;
3000:Had...\n;Had I...?\p;
3100:〔Transfer Student〕“...!”\p;
3200:The transfer student then stood up and beckoned to me. I was completely pale.\p;
3300:She alternated between looking at me—who was still very confused—and the three collapsed people. Tears welled up in the corner of her eyes.\p;
3400:Suddenly, she grabbed my hand and took off running with me in tow—staggering every once in a while.\p;
3500:As soon as we reached the main street, the transfer student let go of my hand.\n;We hadn't run very far, but she was already out of breath.\p;
3600:〔Transfer Student〕“Hahh, haahh...! Hahh...”\p;
3700:〔Takumi〕“Umm...”\p;
3800:〔Transfer Student〕“Ah...”\p;
3900:〔Takumi〕“Nn...”\p;
4000:We both fell silent.\p;
4100:Maybe the transfer student was just as bad at talking as I was.\p;
4200:No, that didn't matter right now. What I needed to do first was figure out what the hell had happened.\p;
4300:I'd been being harassed by those DQNs, and then they'd picked a fight with me.\p;
4400:Then I must've passed out... but how long had I been unconscious...?\p;
4500:〔???〕“About five mini minutes.”\p;
4600:〔Takumi〕“Wh—?!”\p;
4700:Th-There it was again...!\n;I'd heard it again!\p;
4800:I'd thought someone I knew was nearby and was trying to talk to me, but I couldn't see anyone that fit that description.\p;
4900:Dammit... Where were all of these auditory illusions coming from, and why were they all happening today?\p;
5000:〔???〕“It's not an illusion at aaall!”\p;
