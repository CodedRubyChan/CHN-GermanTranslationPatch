0:Everyone was focused on me.\p;
100:I braced myself for it to happen again. Being verbally abused. Laughed at. Humiliated.\p;
200:My legs froze as I recalled the trauma from back then.\p;
300:And yet...\p;
400:〔Festival Participant 1〕“You got this!”\p;
500:〔Festival Participant 2〕“I'll be rooting for you!”\p;
600:〔Festival Participant 3〕“You can do it, Nishijou-kun!”\p;
700:〔Festival Participant 4〕“Go forth and show us a glorious death!”\p;
800:〔Festival Participant 5〕“So young, yet so brave!”\p;
900:〔Festival Participant 6〕“We'll never forget you!”\p;
1000:〔Festival Participant 7〕“We'll watch ya till the very end!”\p;
1100:〔Festival Participant 8〕“Show me you're a real man!”\p;
1200:The onlookers' reactions were different from last time.\n;Rather than insults, everyone was hitting me with kind words of encouragement.\p;
1300:I was so confused, I had to blink a few times.\p;
1400:Were they... cheering me on...?\p;
1500:〔Seira〕“Well, of course? What didja think the festival was for, ya dum-dum?”\p;
1600:〔Seira〕“Everyone's been waitin' for <i>y</i><i>o</i><i>u</i><i>,</i> Takki!”\p;
1700:Before me, a pathway showed itself in the center of a crowd of people.\n;They formed an arch with their arms, urging me to go through.\n;It was just like an elementary school graduation.\p;
1800:Past the many arms was the entrance to O-FRONT.\n;And so, I nervously started heading toward it.\p;
1900:As I walked, words of comfort were thrown my way without end.\p;
2000:Once I stepped inside O-FRONT, even the TATSUYA and Starbricks employees greeted me with applause.\p;
2100:Courage gradually came to me.\n;Courage to finally die.\p;
2200:The rooftop of O-FRONT was just as dark as last time.\n;I gulped.\p;
2300:Reminded of what had transpired the last time I'd come here, I hesitated to move any farther for a moment.\p;
2400:Even after gathering all that courage... I was made painfully aware of how much of a pussy I truly was. No matter what happened, that would never change.\p;
2500:〔???〕“I always believed you would come back.”\p;
2600:Suddenly, a wheelchair creaked.\p;
2700:And together with that noise, just like he had last time, “Shogun” showed himself. He was wearing the Darth Spider helmet today as well.\p;
2800:But “Shogun” wasn't the only one here.\p;
2900:〔Sena〕“You stepped up to the challenge one more time. I'm impressed.”\p;
3000:〔Kozue〕“You're an awesome possum, Takumi-shan!”\p;
3100:〔Yua〕“Thanks to you, Nishijou-kun, I found courage too.”\p;
3200:〔Ayase〕“You are an agent of consummate sublimity, Takumi.”\p;
3300:Sena, Kozupii, Yua, and Ayase. All of them stood in a line, smiling at me.\p;
3400:〔Ayase〕“Let us all leap forth together. Us, and you.”\p;
3500:〔Kozue〕“Soooo, there's no need to be scared♪”\p;
3600:On both sides of me, Kozupii and Ayase took one of my hands each. But it wasn't just us that held hands—Sena and Yua joined us, too. All five of us stood hand in hand.\p;
3700:Was this a recreation of the Group Dive?\p;
3800:The crowd down below, watching us with bated breath, clapped in unison. It was as if they were giving us their blessing. Extolling us.\p;
3900:〔Shogun〕“Farewell. I won't forget you.”\p;
4000:“Shogun” waved us goodbye with his slender hand.\n;Then, Kozupii and Ayase pulled me in.\p;
4100:As if they were inviting me to frolic with them.\n;As if they were inviting me to dance with them.\n;All while they had the most gentle smiles on their faces.\p;
4200:And so, without feeling even an ounce of fear, I...\p;
4300:...ever so smoothly... was able to dance away into the air—\p;
4400:Such thoughts came to mind.\n;How wonderful would it be if I could die such a happy death...\p;
4500:And yet, in the end, it, too, had been a delusion.\p;
4600:The path of people in front of me was real—the path that seemed to guide me forward—but no one was making an arch with their arms.\p;
4700:Everyone looked at me. But their eyes were cold and sharp—staring daggers at me with what felt close to murderous intent.\p;
4800:Everyone was out for blood.\n;No one had been waiting for me.\n;No one had given me their blessing.\p;
4900:All the energy they'd had back when I'd humiliated myself atop O-FRONT was gone.\p;
5000:The reality was, I probably wouldn't be able to die a happy death.\n;But I'd already expected that even before all this.\n;Even so, it didn't matter to me.\p;
5100:As long as I died, it didn't matter.\n;As long as someone killed me, it didn't matter.\n;And so, as I laughed and laughed, I walked through the path between the people.\p;
5200:Everyone was focused on me.\p;
5300:I braced myself for it to happen again. Being verbally abused. Laughed at. Humiliated.\p;
5400:My legs froze as I recalled the trauma from back then.\p;
5500:It was then that someone ran into me. Actually, it might've been more accurate to say that they'd practically hurled themselves at me.\p;
5600:Having been caught by surprise, I lost my balance, but still somehow managed to keep my feet on the ground.\p;
5700:Turning around, I was greeted by a businessman in his twenties. I'd never seen him before.\p;
5800:〔Festival Participant 1〕“Whoa... this is crazy... So this is what it feels like...”\p;
5900:He was staring at his hands and mumbling words to himself that I couldn't make sense of.\n;Just as I was wondering if what he'd done counted as targeted harassment, I felt a sudden heat in my lower back.\p;
6000:And then, I realized there was something foreign in my body.\n;As if something was caught in my lower back.\p;
6100:It ached.\n;It hurt.\n;It burned like hell.\p;
6200:I frantically checked my lower back, my face contorting from the pain.\p;
6300:And in doing so, I found something that looked like the handle of a knife protruding from my back.\p;
6400:Wait... It wasn't simply protruding from my back.\n;No—the knife was lodged in me.\p;
6500:〔Takumi〕“Ngh...!”\p;
6600:The pain grew sharper with each passing second.\n;Before I knew it, my pants were soaked. And I was shocked to realize...\n;...it was all my blood.\p;
6700:〔Festival Participant 2〕“Me next!”\p;
6800:〔Takumi〕“Huh?”\p;
6900:In front of me, a girl—around college age—started to run toward me.\n;She was holding a kitchen knife in her hand, and had a wide grin on her face.\n;With no time to avoid it...\p;
7000:...the knife was stabbed deep into my stomach.\p;
7100:〔Takumi〕“Aah...”\p;
7200:〔Festival Participant 2〕“Aaaahhh! I did it! I stabbed him!”\p;
7300:The girl, now celebrating, immediately stepped away from me.\p;
7400:It was then that I realized: I was surrounded by a crowd full of people.\p;
7500:From students, to workers—from young men, to middle-aged women... Anyone you could think of, they were there, holding knives in their hands. Each and every one stared at me with the same grin on their faces.\p;
7600:And on all four jumbotrons, the same flashy caption bounced around the screen.\p;
7700:“The Long-Awaited \c:255;Offline Meet\c:0;: ‘Let's All Stab the Fake Esper, Nishijou Takumi, to Death!’ Begins!”\p;
7800:Right in front me was an orderly line to wait for something.\n;One that everyone was starting to get in.\p;
7900:They were all... waiting in line... to stab me...\p;
8000:〔Festival Participant 3〕“Hiyah!”\p;
8100:This time, it was a ganguro high school girl.\n;She stabbed me in the side with her knife.\p;
8200:I was having a hard time even registering what was going on. I hadn't even had the chance to feel the pain yet, but it still took every ounce of strength I had to keep standing.\p;
8300:〔Festival Participant 3〕“Ewwww, I got some blood on my hands! This sucks sooo much!”\p;
8400:It was then that an older businessman pushed her aside, and quickly moved toward me with a firm grip on his kitchen knife.\p;
8500:〔Festival Participant 4〕“Gotta relieve all this stress somehow! Haaah!”\p;
8600:That man then pulled out the knife that I'd just been stabbed with... and stabbed me with it again.\p;
8700:〔Takumi〕“Guuhhkkkh...!”\p;
8800:〔Festival Participant 4〕“Haha, this is the best!”\p;
8900:There was already one knife in my back and three in my stomach.\n;All four blades protruded from my body. It was almost comical.\p;
9000:But it wasn't over yet.\n;The “stabbing line” was growing longer and longer.\n;Everyone was waiting maniacally for their chance to stab me, wondering, “Is it my turn yet? Is it my turn yet?”\p;
9100:Having reached my limit, I was about to collapse. But, right as I was about to fall, the first man that had stabbed me came up from behind me, wrapped his arms underneath mine, and held me up.\p;
9200:〔Festival Participant 1〕“Everyone's waitin' in line for this, so no collapsin' just yet, dumbass.”\p;
9300:The moment he said that, I felt yet another intense pain in my back. A cold, hard blade gouged out my skin and bored out my flesh.\p;
9400:〔Takumi〕“Guuhghh...! Sto—”\p;
9500:I was about to tell them to stop, but I held my tongue at the last second.\n;In a manner of speaking, this <i>w</i><i>a</i><i>s</i> what I wished for.\p;
9600:I wanted to be killed, didn't I?\n;So... didn't this mean everything was turning out fine?\n;So don't just tell them to stop, you dumbass...\p;
9700:Held up by the man, unable to even collapse...\p;
9800:...I was stabbed.\p;
9900:In my chest.\p;
10000:In my stomach.\p;
10100:In my back.\p;
10200:In my arms.\p;
10300:In my thighs.\p;
10400:In my fingernails.\p;
10500:〔Takumi〕“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!”\p;
10600:Before I knew it, I was screaming.\p;
10700:I thought I'd be able to hold it back since this was what I wanted, but...\p;
10800:It hurt so much that I just couldn't bear it. I cried out the ugliest cries.\p;
10900:How many blades had I been stabbed with by now?\p;
11000:It was a number too big to count.\p;
11100:〔Takumi〕“GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!”\p;
11200:Having been stabbed so many times, the pain made it impossible for me to move my body anymore. And yet, neither my senses, nor my consciousness, would dull the pain—not even slightly. In fact, they did the exact opposite: they made it clearer and clearer with every passing second.\p;
11300:〔Takumi〕“Euuuuuugh! HoooghaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!”\p;
11400:Just how many times would it take...? Just let me die already...\p;
11500:It hurt so much... why couldn't I just die...?\p;
11600:〔Seira〕“Well, duuuh!”\p;
11700:Seira's voice rang within my mind.\p;
11800:〔Seira〕“It's because this is a delusion!”\p;
11900:Breathing a sigh, I opened my eyes.\n;Both the pain and the feeling of foreign objects inside me were gone.\p;
12000:Right in front of me, instead of a line made up of dozens of people, was a path between dozens of people.\n;A single path, inviting me in.\p;
12100:“How nice it would be if that delusion was actually real...” I thought to myself. “But only if I died at three stabs, that is.”\p;
12200:Spare me all that torture...\p;
12300:Letting my mind wander, I thought about those things as I started making my way through the path between the people.\p;
12400:Both the onlookers and the mass media were incredibly tense.\p;
12500:There was a tiny bit of commotion, but nowhere near the amount you'd normally hear at a festival.\p;
12600:All the energy they'd had back when I'd humiliated myself atop O-FRONT was gone.\p;
12700:Everyone looked at me. Their eyes were cold and sharp—staring daggers at me with what felt close to murderous intent.\p;
12800:Whether I liked it or not, my expectations were swelling higher and higher.\p;
12900:Kill me...
13000:\n;Kill me.
13100:\n;K i l l  m e.\p;
13200:Kill me... Kill me. K i l l  m e.
13300:Suddenly, the wall of people opened up before me, like I was Moses from the Bible.\p;
13400:A single path, inviting me in.\p;
13500:They were all waiting for one person... Me.\p;
13600:“It's the reality TV show that's sweeping the nation! Today's episode? The world's most terrifying \c:255;offline meet\c:0;! People from all over the net have come to lynch the biggest embarrassment in all of Japan, Nishijou Takumi, right in the middle of Shibuya! Their catchphrase? ‘Whose eyes are those eyes?’!”\p;
13700:When that long scenario played out in my mind, I...\p;
13800:...laughed.\p;
13900:〔Takumi〕“Fuhi... fuhihi...”\p;
14000:As much as I hated pain, as long as I would die, I'd be more than willing to deal with that much.\p;
14100:〔Takumi〕“What a perfect f-festival.. for me t-to die at... Fuhihi...”\p;
14200:I had finally grasped what Seira-tan had meant by “revenge.” I hadn't died the last time I was here, so they had prepared this stage just for me.\p;
14300:Forming a lazy smile stemming from the corner of my mouth, I started making my way through the path between the people.\p;
14400:At the end of it, I could see various members of the mass media standing next to each other like idiots, cameras and microphones in hand.\p;
14500:Both the onlookers and the mass media were incredibly tense.\p;
14600:There was a tiny bit of commotion, but nowhere near the amount you'd normally hear at a festival.\p;
14700:All the energy they'd had back when I'd humiliated myself atop O-FRONT was gone.\p;
14800:Everyone looked at me. Their eyes were cold and sharp—staring daggers at me with what felt close to murderous intent.\p;
14900:Whether I liked it or not, my expectations were swelling higher and higher.\p;
15000:Kill me...
15100:\n;Kill me.
15200:\n;K i l l  m e.\p;
15300:Kill me... Kill me. K i l l  m e.
15400:When I looked up, I realized that all four of the enormous jumbotrons were showing footage of me walking through the crowd.\p;
15500:I was sure that, just like last time, this was a national broadcast too. If the viewer rate was even 40%, I would die while being watched by approximately 48 million people.\p;
15600:The death of me, who was no more than a delusionary existence.\n;The death of me, who had no value whatsoever.\n;The death of me, who was wholly and entirely worthless.\p;
15700:Is that what you all want to see? Well then, congratu-fuckin'-lations. Here you go.\p;
15800:It doesn't matter either way to me. As long as I die, I don't care how many people see it.\p;
15900:And so, I stood before the battery of cameras and microphones.\p;
16000:A swarm of flashes burst in unison.\p;
16100:Blinding lights flashed intermittently.\p;
16200:Straining my eyes, I fought to endure them.\p;
16300:Then, a reporter that was probably in his 40s spoke up. I had seen him on a number of talk shows before.\p;
16400:〔Entertainment Reporter A〕“Nishijou-kun, what kind of performance are you planning to show us today?”\p;
16500:〔Takumi〕“...”\p;
16600:〔Entertainment Reporter A〕“And while I've got you here, there's been some talk about the Cruc-affixion suspect that was arrested this morning. The people're saying that they were just a pawn, and that the mastermind's still out there. You got any thoughts on this, my friend?”\p;
16700:Why was this random guy acting all buddy-buddy with me?\p;
16800:And what was that last part supposed to mean? Was he asking for my opinion?\p;
16900:Huh, I guess when the media called up the criminal psychology professors every time, and they always said the same standard, uninteresting bullshit, even an amateur like me could serve as a replacement.\p;
17000:Regardless, I couldn't have any less of an opinion on what the guy was asking about.\p;
17100:I had lost all interest in New Gen. I'd come here to be killed, not to answer questions. I had no energy for it.\p;
17200:〔Entertainment Reporter A〕“Well, anyway, Nishijou-kun, I'll just get straight to the point.”\p;
17300:〔Entertainment Reporter A〕“The true culprit is commonly referred to as ‘Whose eyes are those eyes?’”\p;
17400:〔Takumi〕“...”\p;
17500:〔Entertainment Reporter A〕“And there's been some rumors about it potentially being you.”\p;
17600:〔Takumi〕“It... very well might be...”\p;
17700:My whispers were broadcast all throughout Shibuya via the jumbotron speakers. Commotion ensued.\p;
17800:The bloodthirsty atmosphere got even stronger among the people gathered here.\p;
17900:〔Takumi〕“I don't... care...”\p;
18000:Just kill me already...\n;Set me free.\n;Stop asking me for things.\p;
18100:And yet, despite my wishes, the microphones came even closer. They were pushed so violently toward me, the next step would be shoving one straight in my mouth.\p;
18200:The other reporters, too, were raining questions down on me incessantly.\p;
18300:〔Entertainment Reporter B〕“Are we to take this as you admitting to having a part in this case?”\p;
18400:〔Entertainment Reporter C〕“Have you ever been unable to distinguish video games from reality?”\p;
18500:〔Entertainment Reporter B〕“What is your relationship with the suspect that was just arrested, Komaeda? Please give us a statement!”\p;
18600:〔Entertainment Reporter C〕“Do you view killing people like it's some kind of video game?”\p;
18700:In a sense, I was like a video game character.\n;Someone... please reset me...\n;Just get me to game over once and for all...\p;
18800:〔Takumi〕“Just... kill me already...”\p;
18900:As soon as those words left my mouth,\n;the crowd, at the peak of its tension,\n;exploded.\p;
19000:〔Festival Participant 1〕“Kill yourself!”\p;
19100:〔Festival Participant 2〕“Inhuman garbage!”\p;
19200:〔Festival Participant 3〕“Goddamn savage!”\p;
19300:〔Festival Participant 4〕“I'll kill you myself!”\p;
19400:〔Festival Participant 5〕“Burn in hell!”\p;
19500:〔Festival Participant 6〕“Get the death penalty!”\p;
19600:〔Festival Participant 7〕“I'll fuckin' kill you!”\p;
19700:〔Festival Participant 8〕“Murderer!”\p;
19800:I was overwhelmed by the waves of people,\n;and as the screams and shouts swarmed,\n;I was swallowed up by the undulating masses.\p;
19900:I was tossed around and jostled,\n;crushed to nothing and pulverized.\p;
20000:Being shoved by people in all directions, my body started floating. My soles left the ground.\p;
20100:No matter how much I struggled, I couldn't do anything.\n;I was struck on the head, punched in the arms...\p;
20200:But none of it was painful enough to kill me.\n;And with no room to breathe, I started to suffocate.\n;But I didn't resist.\p;
20300:I entrusted my body to the chaos.\n;And in doing so, the pressure suddenly disappeared,\n;and my body fell to the floor.\p;
20400:Seira-tan fell from my hand and toppled onto the asphalt.\p;
20500:Countless feet lined up like trees in a forest, and as they writhed about, my waifu rolled through the gaps between them. Despite extending my hand, I couldn't reach her.\p;
20600:Her face, complete with that endlessly radiant smile of hers...\n;...the smile that soothed my soul...\n;...was stepped on by someone's shoe.\p;
20700:〔Seira〕“Takki! It hurts! Help me, Takki!”\p;
20800:Her small body was kicked farther away...\n;...and some lady in red high heels...\n;...ended up crushing her torso.\p;
20900:〔Seira〕“Ta...kki... Ya... big...”\p;
21000:〔Takumi〕“Seira...?”\p;
21100:No matter how much I called out to her, no answer came.\p;
21200:My one and only ally, was gone.\p;
21300:It felt like my chest was being crushed by sorrow.\n;I had lost all reason to stay in this world. To live.\p;
21400:And when I looked up...\n;surrounded by people as I was...\n;even the night sky was hidden away from me.\p;
21500:No one noticed I was there, slumped down on the ground.\p;
21600:Even though I was right here...\n;Even though I was asking for someone to kill me...\p;
21700:Why was everyone ignoring me?!\p;
21800:〔Takumi〕“Aah...”\p;
21900:Suddenly.\p;
22000:I felt it. Right on the nape of my neck.\p;
22100:That tingling sensation...\p;
22200:“God's gaze.”\p;
22300:〔???〕“You...”\p;
22400:And within my mind...\p;
22500:〔???〕“...can't die here.”\p;
22600:...a certain voice rang.\p;
22700:I gulped...\p;
22800:〔???〕“Obtain your DI-sword.”\p;
22900:...and firmly gritted my back teeth.\p;
23000:〔Takumi〕“‘Shogun’...!”\p;
23100:I searched for that wheelchair among the crowd. For that bastard cosplaying as Darth Spider.\p;
23200:So you were the one behind this “festival,” huh? I knew it.\n;Are you planning to wheel out here and threaten me, all while you're in your offensive Darth Spider cosplay?\n;You trying to recreate what happened last time?\p;
23300:I wished for death. The entire time I'd been alive, I'd just been some tool for everyone's amusement. And I couldn't take it anymore.\p;
23400:〔Shogun〕“The ‘Shogun’ from back then wasn't me.”\p;
23500:〔Shogun〕“I don't tend to cosplay.”\p;
23600:I don't care... Just kill me, please...\p;
23700:〔Shogun〕“They're starting to take action.”\p;
23800:〔Shogun〕“This place will soon turn even more chaotic than it already is.”\p;
23900:They...?\p;
24000:〔Shogun〕“The masterminds behind everything. The ones causing this chaos. And the people using it for their own interests.”\p;
24100:〔Shogun〕“No one but you... can stop them.”\p;
24200:I stood up.\p;
24300:The angry voices kept surging above my head.\p;
24400:No one was looking at me.\n;The onlookers and the people from the media were all jumbled together.\n;Grabbing each other, cursing at each other, punching each other...\p;
24500:Why were they...\p;
24600:〔Shogun〕“The Silent Weapon...”\p;
24700:〔Shogun〕“‘Noah II’ is already in operation.”\p;
24800:〔Shogun〕“The one and only motive behind this chaos...”\p;
24900:〔Shogun〕“...is indiscriminate human experimentation.”\p;
25000:〔Takumi〕“...!”\p;
25100:Something hard hit my head.\p;
25200:A sharp pain ran through me—a pain so intense, I thought my skull had been broken. My hands automatically shot up to my head, cradling it.\p;
25300:As I looked around with tears in my eyes, I found a rock on the ground the size of a fist. A tiny smear of blood colored part of it.\p;
25400:Someone had thrown that rock, and it'd hit me.\p;
25500:A throbbing pain coursed through me. Moving my hand toward the source, my fingers touched something sticky.\n;Bringing my hand down in front of my face, I saw blood on my fingertips.\n;My own blood.\p;
25600:〔Festival Participant 2〕“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!”\p;
25700:I heard a dry explosion in the distance.\n;Followed by a lady screaming.\p;
25800:A gunshot...?\n;There were people with guns here...?\p;
25900:Why was everyone so worked up...?\p;
26000:Why was everyone fighting each other despite being total strangers...?\p;
26100:Why was this... so chaotic...?\p;
26200:The “villain's sacrifice” everyone was waiting for... wasn't mine?\p;
26300:〔Shogun〕“Shibuya's GE rate... biorhythms, are rising to unprecedented levels.”\p;
26400:〔Shogun〕“Like I told you before. Indiscriminate human experimentation.”\p;
26500:〔Shogun〕“Everyone here is under an invisible ‘attack.’”\p;
26600:Then, I heard a sound. A creaking, rusty sound.\p;
26700:A sound akin to a dying woman gasping for air.\p;
26800:The sound of a wheelchair.\p;
26900:Despite how many people there were...\n;Despite the wall of people surging erratically...\n;“Shogun” moved his wheelchair forward.\p;
27000:And, without bumping into anyone... Without getting dragged into a single fight... he made his way straight to me.\n;\p;
27100:Ever so small, with a body of skin and bone.\n;He was covered in wrinkles, and looked so frail, it was as if he might break at the slightest touch.\p;
27200:His eyes were cloudy as could be. I didn't know what he was looking at, nor what he saw through those eyes.\p;
27300:I couldn't bring myself to look away anymore.\n;And suddenly, the tumult surrounding me began to grow distant.\p;
27400:〔Shogun〕“I've been watching you. Always.”\p;
27500:It was the same voice as the time we had first met.\n;It wasn't that strange voice I had heard at O-FRONT.\p;
27600:〔Takumi〕“Who... are you...?”\p;
27700:〔Shogun〕“I'm you.”\p;
27800:And with those few words, I finally understood.\p;
27900:〔Takumi〕“The one who envisioned me in a delusion... The one who created me...”\p;
28000:〔Takumi〕“The one behind ‘God's gaze’...”\p;
28100:〔Takumi〕“...was you...”\p;
28200:〔Shogun〕“Yes.”\p;
28300:He was my creator.\n;The existence who had envisioned me within a delusion.\n;Someone who I could never hope to match up to.\p;
28400:〔Takumi〕“What's... your name...?”\p;
28500:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“...Nishijou Takumi.”\p;
28600:The real me.\n;The original me.\p;
28700:〔Takumi〕“How... old are you...?”\p;
28800:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“The same as you. As far as your ‘backstory’ goes, that is.”\p;
28900:〔Takumi〕“...”\p;
29000:17 years old...\n;Even though he was so small... Even though he was covered in wrinkles...\n;He was only 17 years old...\p;
29100:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“If things stay this way, the world will die.”\p;
29200:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“Everyone's mind will be put under the control of Noah II.”\p;
29300:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“That's why I entrusted it to you.”\p;
29400:Entrusted...? Entrusted what, exactly...?\p;
29500:〔Takumi〕“I don't... understand... I have... n-nothing to do with... any of this...”\p;
29600:〔Takumi〕“I beg you... erase me... I want you to... erase me... Hurry...”\p;
29700:“Shogun”'s wrinkles stirred.\n;He was likely making an expression, but I couldn't see it as anything other than wrinkles shifting on his face.\p;
29800:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“This is all... my fault.”\p;
29900:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“All because I happened to delude ‘Ir2’...”\p;
30000:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“I tried my best to stop it... but with my body like this, I couldn't do what I wanted to.”\p;
30100:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“That was when I created you.”\p;
30200:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“To have you stop it.”\p;
30300:〔Takumi〕“I know nothing... about any of that... Just because I'm your copy... doesn't mean I want to do the same things you do...”\p;
30400:〔Takumi〕“If the copy is the only one who has to suffer... I don't want to be a copy...”\p;
30500:〔Takumi〕“Just let me die...”\p;
30600:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“You're not a copy. You're another me.”\p;
30700:〔Takumi〕“In other words... a copy...”\p;
30800:〔Takumi〕“Do you realize... how horrible what you're doing is...?”\p;
30900:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“I know. And I could never apologize enough.”\p;
31000:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“But there was no other way.”\p;
31100:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“It is no overstatement to say... that the fate of the world rests on your shoulders.”\p;
31200:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“That's why—”\p;
31300:〔Takumi〕“Why...”\p;
31400:〔Takumi〕“Why can't you just ask Rimi to do it...?”\p;
31500:〔Takumi〕“You're acquaintances after all...”\p;
31600:“Acquaintances.”\p;
31700:I'd said that on purpose.\n;I didn't want to think they were lovers or good friends.\p;
31800:And so, only then did I realize my feelings.\p;
31900:I was jealous of the original me.\n;That was rich, coming from a delusionary existence.\p;
32000:What a fucking disgrace... I couldn't believe myself.\p;
32100:There was not knowing your place, and then there was this.\p;
32200:My own feelings made me want to throw up.\p;
32300:My emotions continued to spiral.\p;
32400:I wanted to die...\p;
32500:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“Rimi left to save Nanami... but was imprisoned instead.”\p;
32600:〔Takumi〕“Huh...?”\p;
32700:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“Rimi... well... she tried to save me.”\p;
32800:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“The reason being...”\p;
32900:〔<i>T</i><i>a</i><i>k</i><i>u</i><i>m</i><i>i</i>〕“...one you should already ‘know.’”\p;
