0:The sound of the bell told me that all classes were done for the day. The second it went off, I packed up my things, got up from my desk, and left the classroom.\p;
100:I couldn't stand the subtle distance I felt between me and Rimi for a second longer, so I wanted to get out of the classroom ASAP.\p;
200:Besides, I also had to stop by Mangadarake today.\p;
300:In the end, I hadn't been able to say a single word to Rimi.\p;
400:I'd had several chances to talk to her, but just like this morning, I'd kept my mouth locked shut the entire time.\p;
500:I might've screwed up by doing that. It would make it even <i>m</i><i>o</i><i>r</i><i>e</i> difficult to talk to her the next time I saw her.\p;
600:I was sinking deeper and deeper into the thick swamp that was trying to figure out how the hell to act around Rimi.\p;
700:〔Nanami〕“Ah, Big Bro!”\p;
800:Just as I was about to leave the school building, I was hit with the voice of a certain irritating person.\p;
900:Nanami came running up to me, holding a trash can in her hands. She must've been in the middle of taking it out.\p;
1000:Unfortunately for me, the bitch'd spotted me. I tried to ignore her and speed my way out of there, but just like usual, Nanami refused to let that happen.\p;
1100:The hem of my uniform was pulled tightly from behind.\p;
1200:〔Nanami〕“How many times do I have to tell you not to run away from me?!”\p;
1300:〔Takumi〕“Wh-What do you want...”\p;
1400:〔Nanami〕“Don't give me that!”\p;
1500:〔Nanami〕“Don't you realize I have to chase after you whenever you run away?! It's kind of annoying!”\p;
1600:Okay, then don't chase after me if you don't need something...\p;
1700:〔Nanami〕“You haven't been calling home at all, which is nothing new. But whatever, I've already given up on trying to get you to do it. I doubt you ever will at this point.”\p;
1800:...Wow, she actually understood me for once. Then again, I didn't know how she wouldn't, being my sister and all. Even though I had no need in the slightest for a 3D one.\p;
1900:〔Nanami〕“So that's why I'm gonna have to keep coming to your room every now and then to check up on you.”\p;
2000:〔Nanami〕“You should be grateful.”\p;
2100:Dammit, of course it'd come to this... If only I could somehow be freed from the curse of my obnoxious little sister.\p;
2200:Hell, even though it'd never happen, I at least deserved <i>s</i><i>o</i><i>m</i><i>e</i> form of compensation for putting up with her.\p;
2300:I thought about that kind of thing daily.\p;
2400:Oh, that was it! This was my chance to put my plan from earlier into action! If I was lucky, it might even work as a modest form of revenge.\p;
2500:I checked my surroundings, then I started walking toward the courtyard, signaling for Nanami to follow me.\p;
2600:〔Nanami〕“Huh? What is it?”\p;
2700:〔Takumi〕“J-Just... come with me...”\p;
2800:〔Nanami〕“Why? What's going on?”\p;
2900:She was so unbelievably annoying.\p;
3000:Was she incapable of following me or something? What a fucking idiot.\p;
3100:〔Takumi〕“N-Nanami... I have an important favor... to ask you.”\p;
3200:〔Nanami〕“Huh? A favor? From you?”\p;
3300:Nanami's eyes went wide.\p;
3400:〔Nanami〕“Wow, that doesn't happen often. You never ask me to do stuff.”\p;
3500:〔Takumi〕“J-Just shut up... and follow me...”\p;
3600:〔Nanami〕“Ah, wait up!”\p;
3700:There weren't many people in the courtyard.\p;
3800:During lunchtime, the place was always crowded with students eating lunch, but the only people who'd bother coming here after school were from the gardening club or whatever.\p;
3900:〔Nanami〕“Okay, so what's the favor?”\p;
4000:Nanami lowered the trash can she was carrying to the ground, then gave a big grin as she puffed out her chest.\p;
4100:〔Nanami〕“Oh, but I've got one condition—you've gotta treat me to McD's afterward. As long as you do that, I'll do whatever you want. Even though I don't really wanna.”\p;
4200:Grrr, every little goddamn thing she did pissed me off... I couldn't believe she actually wanted me to pay her back for this.\p;
4300:Didn't help that I'd already treated her to McD's before, too.\n;...Forget it.\p;
4400:〔Takumi〕“F-Fine. I'll treat you.”\p;
4500:〔Nanami〕“Huh, really?! Wow, you're like a totally different person today!”\p;
4600:Well yeah, because I was lying! Fuhihi, \c:255;soz\c:0; for being a liar lololol\p;
4700:And with that, I handed Nanami my cell phone.\p;
4800:I then asked her to call the prank caller whose number was stored in my call history: 03-X733-X991.\p;
4900:〔Nanami〕“You want me to call a number off your history? Who are they?”\p;
5000:〔Takumi〕“S-Someone I know from online...”\p;
5100:Nanami was tilting her head with a suspicious expression on her face, so I quickly told a lie that would seem plausible to her.\p;
5200:〔Nanami〕“Sooo... why am <i>I</i> doing it?”\p;
5300:〔Takumi〕“Y-You'll know... if you call them...”\p;
5400:〔Nanami〕“Hmmm, you're not plotting something, are you...?”\p;
5500:Oh my goooood, STFUUUUUU!\p;
5600:All you have to do is just shut up and do what I say!\p;
5700:If you can't even do that, then just go home! I have no use for you!\p;
5800:〔Takumi〕“F-Fine, then I won't ask... you to do it...”\p;
5900:I went to snatch back the cell phone, but Nanami pulled her hand back, evading me.\p;
6000:〔Nanami〕“O-Okay! I'll call them! That's all I have to do, right?”\p;
6100:〔Nanami〕“You really are selfish, y'know.”\p;
6200:Yeah, you should talk.\p;
6300:Choking back my anger, I watched with bated breath as Nanami dialed the number in question.\p;
6400:Nanami, blissfully unaware, put the cell phone to her ear and waited for them to answer.\p;
6500:I noticed that, on the hand she was holding the cell phone with, she was wearing a yellow bangle.\p;
6600:That was the one I'd given her, wasn't it? Then again, it was more something she'd just decided to appropriate rather than me actually giving it to her.\p;
6700:She even wore it when she went to school...? Did she really like it that much?\p;
6800:Even though it was just some cheap-ass bangle I'd gotten for free?\p;
6900:Nanami really did have no taste at all.\n;Not that I could really speak for anyone else, though.\p;
7000:...This didn't matter at all right now.\p;
7100:Anyway, who was gonna answer the phone? Would it be some scary DQN piece of garbage?\p;
7200:Best case scenario, it'd just be a prank and had nothing to do with “Shogun” or Yua.\p;
7300:〔Nanami〕“Um, hello...?”\p;
7400:Someone must've picked up, so Nanami called out as she covered the receiver with her hand.\p;
7500:Only to raise her eyebrows soon after.\n;She then thrust the phone back in my direction.\p;
7600:〔Nanami〕“Big Broooooo...!”\p;
7700:〔Takumi〕“Wh-Wh-Wh-What?”\p;
7800:〔Nanami〕“Don't give me ‘What?’! It's saying the number's not in use right now!”\p;
7900:〔Takumi〕“Wha...?”\p;
8000:I snatched the phone from Nanami and put it to my ear.\n;And what I heard was...\p;
8100:〔Voicemail〕“—ched a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please che—”\p;
8200:She was right... I guess that meant it really had been a prank, huh...\p;
8300:It was a prank where you called a bunch of random numbers simultaneously over a couple days, and when the prank was over, both the number and the phone were destroyed... or something like that.\p;
8400:Either way, it was a pretty large-scale prank.\p;
8500:But meh, didn't matter to me either way.\p;
8600:I knew now that the mysterious call had been nothing more than a prank, and nothing else mattered anymore.\p;
8700:〔Nanami〕“Okay, what the heck was up with that?”\p;
8800:〔Takumi〕“I-I don't need you anymore...”\p;
8900:〔Nanami〕“Whaaa?”\p;
9000:Leaving Nanami standing there, I started to walk off.\n;But it didn't take long for her to chase after me.\p;
9100:〔Nanami〕“Wait just a sec! What was that all about?!”\p;
9200:Just shut up already...\p;
9300:〔Takumi〕“You were t-taking out the trash, weren't you...?”\p;
9400:〔Takumi〕“You left the trash can over there.”\p;
9500:〔Nanami〕“Oh, right...”\p;
9600:〔Nanami〕“B-But you still haven't told me what's going on!”\p;
9700:〔Takumi〕“I'm going h-home.”\p;
9800:Without dealing with Nanami, I walked quickly to the school gate with her right on my tail.\p;
9900:〔Nanami〕“Fine, just remember you promised to treat me to McD's! You'd better not forget!”\p;
10000:〔Takumi〕“Like I care...”\p;
10100:〔Nanami〕“Hey! Did you lie to me?!”\p;
10200:〔Takumi〕“Maybe...”\p;
10300:〔Nanami〕“Grr...!”\p;
10400:Nanami stopped dead in her tracks, looking pretty upset.\p;
10500:But I kept right on moving.\p;
10600:〔Nanami〕“You big jerk!”\p;
10700:She yelled out in a voice loud enough to echo throughout the entire area.\p;
10800:Fed up with her, I went to turn around, and saw her glaring at me with her hands on her hips.\p;
10900:〔Nanami〕“A jerk like you should get their brain shriveled up by cell phone radiation and die!”\p;
11000:Shit. Thanks to Nanami's screeching, more eyes were looking our way.\n;Even though I made it a point to stand out as little as possible at school.\p;
11100:My sister was the most obnoxious shithead of all time!\p;
11200:Not giving a damn about what Nanami had said, I ran off toward the school gate.\p;
11300:It was best to retreat in times like this.\p;
11400:〔Nanami〕“<i>J</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>e</i><i>r</i><i>k</i><i>!</i> ”\p;
11500:Nanami's voice could still be heard even after I passed through the school gate, making me feel completely and utterly drained.\p;
